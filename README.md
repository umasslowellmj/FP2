DUE March 30, 2015 Monday (2015-03-30)



### My Library: math/number theory

### As part of the math calculation based on web server, I also wanted to create visual graphs of some procedures. User can input the function and see the graphs. The data is also handled same as previous code. Sent from webserver and this code independently implements the function, then sends back the result.
